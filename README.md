Best Practices and Implementations

Hi there! My name is Juan Krzemien (AKA _Ruso_).
  
I'm a Software Engineer living in Mar del Plata, Argentina.

Lately, I've been working on different Quality Engineering areas and industries 
so I've compiled a little bit of my experience in here.
  
I'd recommend you to take a look at the documentation folder before diving into the code directly.

I'm always looking to improve my working conditions (specially if it takes me to other places of the world) so [send me an email](mailto:ruso.tandil@gmail.com) if you have any job offer / proposal:

 * Email: ruso.tandil@gmail.com
 * Check my CV at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jkrzemien/)
 
 Also, if you notice any errors in the documentation, please, let me know.
 
 
 Cheers,
 
 **Ruso**
